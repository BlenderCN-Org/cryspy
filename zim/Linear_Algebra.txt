====== Linear Algebra ======
Created Wednesday 18 May 2016

We use the following conventions:

===== Position vectors =====
They are column-matrices like this:

{{./equation.png?type=equation}}

===== Difference vectors =====
They are column-matrices like this:

{{./equation001.png?type=equation}}

===== Reciprocal vectors / Wave vectors =====
They are row-matrices (of type "Matrix", **not(!)** of type "Row"):

{{./equation002.png?type=equation}}

===== Basis transformations / symmetry elements / ... =====
They are 4x4-matrices of the following shape:

{{./equation003.png?type=equation}}

Leftmultiplication of this Matrix onto Difference vector or Rightmultiplication onto reciprocal vector means "appliying Matrix {{./equation004.png?type=equation}}".
Leftmultiplication of this Matrix onto Position vector means "first applying Matrix {{./equation005.png?type=equation}}, then shifting with vector {{./equation006.png?type=equation}} .

==== Basis transformations ====

Let there be two Bases {{./equation009.png?type=equation}} and {{./equation010.png?type=equation}} with Origins {{./equation011.png?type=equation}} and {{./equation012.png?type=equation}} .
Now a Point {{./equation013.png?type=equation}} in Space can be written in two different ways:

{{./equation014.png?type=equation}}

So, the Point can be expressed as column-vector:

{{./equation015.png?type=equation}}


The Basis-Transformation is

{{./equation016.png?type=equation}} 

with

{{./equation017.png?type=equation}} .

cryspy_fromstr constructs such a Transformation in the following way:
Let {{./equation018.png?type=equation}} be numbers. Then the expression

{{./equation019.png?type=equation}}

(inserted in cryspy_fromstr.fromstr()) means:

{{./equation020.png?type=equation}}

So if, for example, you want to make the new a-axis the old a+b and shift the origin along 1/4 c, then you get the transformation by:

'''
cryspy_fromstr.fromstr("a+b,b,c+1/4")
'''
