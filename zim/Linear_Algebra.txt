====== Linear Algebra ======
Created Wednesday 18 May 2016

We use the following conventions:

===== Position vectors =====
They are column-matrices like this:

{{./equation.png?type=equation}}

===== Difference vectors =====
They are column-matrices like this:

{{./equation001.png?type=equation}}

===== Reciprocal vectors / Wave vectors =====
They are row-matrices (of type "Matrix", **not(!)** of type "Row"):

{{./equation002.png?type=equation}}

===== Basis transformations / symmetry elements / ... =====
They are 4x4-matrices of the following shape:

{{./equation003.png?type=equation}}

Leftmultiplication of this Matrix onto Difference vector or Rightmultiplication onto reciprocal vector means "appliying Matrix {{./equation004.png?type=equation}}".
Leftmultiplication of this Matrix onto Position vector means "first applying Matrix {{./equation005.png?type=equation}}, then shifting with vector {{./equation006.png?type=equation}} .
