====== Wish List ======
Created Friday 08 April 2016

===== Objects =====
* Position-Vector
* Difference-Vector
* Wave-Vector
* Metric
* Transformation
* Atom
* Asymmetric Unit
* Symmetry
* Cell
* finite Factor-Group (in symmorphic case equivalent to point group)
* Set of translation generators
* Space group

===== Mathematical features =====

==== Numbers ====
Maybe we can calculate with exact rational numbers.
Is this usefull with respect to Transformations with diagonals?

==== Vectorspace operations ====
* Position-Vector - Position-Vector = Difference-Vector
* Position-Vector + Difference-Vector = Difference-Vector + Position-Vector = Position-Vector
* float * Difference-Vector = Difference-Vector * float = Difference-Vector
* Wave-Vector - Wave-Vector = Wave-Vector
* Wave-Vector + Wave-Vector = Wave-Vector
* float * Wave-Vector = Wave-Vector * float = Wave-Vector

==== Transformations ====
* Transformation * Metric = Metric
* Transformation * Position-Vector = Position-Vector
* Transformation * Wave-Vector = Wave-Vector
* Transformation * Symmetry = Symmetry

==== Scalar-Products ====
* Difference-Vector *(Metric) Difference-Vector = float
* Wave-Vector *(Metric) Wave-Vector = float
* Wave-Vector * Difference-Vector = float (independent from Metric!!!)

==== Symmetry ====

===== Input/Read-in features =====

===== Plotting features =====
