====== Virtual Environment ======
Created Sonntag 10 April 2016

In order to get sure that the same python is running on every machine, we work with a virtual python-environment ("virtuelle Werkbank", [hubertz2016 S19ff]).

If
'''
pyvenv
'''
does not work, maybe instead
'''
python3 -m venv
'''
will work.

===== Entering the Virtural Environment =====
The virtual envirentment is stored in wb.
Entering:

'''
source wb/bin/activate
'''


===== Exiting =====
'''
deactivate
'''


===== Installing Python-Modules =====
Modules are installed using
'''
pip install -r requirements.txt
'''


===== I made changes in the installed Modules (e.g. added a module). How can I apply this to requirements.txt? =====
'''
pip freeze > requirements.txt
'''
